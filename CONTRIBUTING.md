# Contributing
Contributions of all types are welcome.
We use GitHub as our bug and feature tracker both for code and for other aspects of the library (documentation, the wiki, etc.).


## Filing issues
When in doubt, file an issue. We'd rather close a few duplicate issues than let a problem go unnoticed.
Similarly if you support a particular feature request, feel free to let us know by commenting on the issue to the issue.

To file a new issue, please use our issue template and fill out the template as much as possible (remove irrelevant parts).
The more information you can provide, the more likely we are to be able help.


## Contributing code
Pull requests are welcome for all parts of the codebase, especially the integration libraries.
If you'd like to contribute code, you will need to sign apache 2.0 license agreement.
